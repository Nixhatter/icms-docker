A full CentOS environment for developing a PHP Application with Docker.

# When should you use this?
If you want to create a dev environment that mimics your production server. It also comes with tools to help development like xdebug. This is a smaller and faster solution then setting up a virtual environment or vagrant.

# When should you NOT use this?
If you're looking for a lightweight PHP dev environment. This project was me not fully understanding how to utilize docker.

# About
This was first made to help me develop a basic PHP application on Windows. It should work with most apps like Wordpress or Joomla because it just runs your standard PHP setup.

# Contact
Feel free to send me questions or if you need help with the setup.
